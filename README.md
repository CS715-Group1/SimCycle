## Hardware Requirements
There are no specific hardware requirements for running the simulations. However, your system should support Unity Editor 2022.3.6f1.

# Installation
1. Please ensure you have Unity Editor 2022.3.6f1 installed. You can do this through Unity Hub.
2. Clone this repo and open it as a project in Unity Hub.

# Running the Simulation
There are two parts that demonstrates the system:
- Scenario simulation
- Vision system demo

## Scenario Simulation
1. Navigate to Assets > Scenes > Scenarios.
2. Choose one of the four scenarios, for example: `Scenario_B`.
3. Press the Play button in the Unity Editor.
4. From 

## Vision System Demo
1. Navigate to Assets > Scenes and open the `Revised_Vision` scene.
